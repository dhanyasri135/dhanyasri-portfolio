              <p>Primary author of a research paper analyzing climate vulnerabilities and adaptation strategies in 43 global megacities.</p>

              <ul>
                <b>Abstract:</b> With their rapid expansion and escalating population densities, megacities face unprecedented challenges in ensuring climate resilience. Our research examines how megacities worldwide plan to adapt to climate change. Specifically, we evaluate the resilience and adaptive capacity enumerated in 43 global megacity climate reports by categorizing and coding data across five key dimensions: infrastructure systems, climate risks, natural disasters, financial sources, and stakeholder involvement. We analyze trends and relationships between variables across these megacity reports to deduce global trends in these urban areas using statistical analysis. Three key patterns emerge from our analysis of these megacity adaptation plans: (1) there is global convergence on the need for sustainable transportation infrastructure, (2) there is some misalignment between local climate risks and chosen adaptation investments, and (3) we found considerable underrepresentation of local stakeholders in planning processes. By identifying key areas of vulnerability, infrastructure plans, financial backing, and stakeholders, our research underscores gaps in current planning approaches that could be addressed in the future to make megacities safer and more sustainable.

              <p><strong>Co-Author:</strong> Gore, C., et al. (2026). Environmental Research: Climate.</p>
              <p>Co-Authored a research paper in association with NIST by coding and categorizing co-benefits from 430+ scientific articles.</p>
              <ul>
                <b>Abstract:</b> Adaptations to extreme weather events are increasing in prevalence across the globe. Adaptation responses can produce cobenefits, which are ancillary positive outcomes beyond the primary objectives of reducing risk and enhancing resilience.
Despite growing attention to co-benefits in the adaptation literature, systematic analyses across adaptation types, sectors,
actors, and regions remain limited. This study uses the Global Adaptation Mapping Initiative (GAMI) database to investigate
the associations between adaptation characteristics and the presence of co-benefits. We processed and coded 1,684 articles, to
categorize co-benefits and analyzed them alongside other adaptation characteristics through descriptive statistics, chi-squared
tests, and logistic regressions. We found generally weak associations between adaptation characteristics and the presence of
co-benefits. Further, the regression results showed that there were no significant differences between the associations with cobenefits of adaptations that occur across economic sectors. Ecosystem based responses were found to be more likely to be
associated with the presence of co-benefits than human behavioral based responses. Technical or infrastructural responses
were found to be less likely to be associated with co-benefits than human behavioral responses. Additionally, while some of
the chi-squared associations and regression associations trended together, they also differed leading to ambiguity in the types
of adaptations that often have co-benefits present. These findings highlight the need for improved co-benefit assessment
frameworks and enhanced co-benefit documentation. Enhanced documentation could better inform adaptation planning and
maximize the ancillary benefits of adaptation actions.

                <h3>⚡ San Diego Renewable Energy Transition Model</h3>
                <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Cities commit to renewable energy goals but lack quantitative models to predict actual emissions reductions and cost impacts over multi-year transitions.</p>
                
                <p><strong>What I Built:</strong> Developed a forecasting model using scaled CAISO operational data (2018-2025) to simulate San Diego's transition to 60% renewable electricity by 2034. Modeled coal-to-renewable shift scenarios and exponential adoption curves reflecting infrastructure realities.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Key Findings:</strong> Projected $1.56M annual operational savings and 27,000+ metric tons of CO₂ reduction per year. Demonstrated how decentralized renewables enhance urban resilience to wildfires and grid outages.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Delivered scalable, data-driven framework for municipal climate and energy transition planning.</p>
              </div>

            <div class="card">
                <h3>🔋 Metadata-Driven Energy & Climate Data Lakehouse (AWS)</h3>
                <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Energy providers and climate researchers use different data formats (XML, JSON) with inconsistent schemas, making cross-domain analysis nearly impossible. Legacy APIs have strict limitations and authentication requirements.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Solution I Built:</strong> Designed a serverless AWS lakehouse architecture that dynamically ingests, transforms, and analyzes energy and weather data without hard-coded logic. Created a custom XML parser to handle schema drift, normalized disparate data into unified Parquet format, and enabled SQL-based analytics to correlate solar radiation with grid load patterns.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Technical Approach:</strong> AWS Glue + DynamoDB for metadata-driven ingestion | Python (Boto3) for resilient API handling | Parquet optimization for storage | Athena for cross-domain SQL analysis</p>
                
                <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Automated data pipeline handling multiple source formats, enabling real-time insights into renewable energy impact on grid stability.</p>

            <h3>� Scootistic DC - Urban Mobility Survey & Analysis</h3>
            <p><strong>Problem:</strong> DC residents juggle multiple ride-sharing providers (Capital Bikeshare, Lime, Veo) with separate subscriptions, creating friction and reducing adoption of sustainable transportation.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Research Approach:</strong> Designed conjoint survey modeling vehicle options, ride duration caps, and pricing structures. Conducted regression analysis with 95% confidence intervals and power analysis (450-500 sample size) to identify optimal service configuration.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Proposed integrated subscription model with platform partnership strategy, backed by quantitative evidence of user preferences for flexible multi-modal access.</p>

            <h3>📶 5G Waveforms Performance Analysis over 3D Channel Model</h3>
            <p><strong>Bachelors Final Project</strong></p>
            <p>Compares various 5G waveform modulation techniques (like OFDM, FBMC, UFMC, etc.) across 3D wireless channel models to identify the most efficient method. The study concludes that FBMC outperforms others in terms of low PAPR and BER, and proposes future research using AI/ML for adaptive waveform selection.</p>

            <h3>🌍 AI-Powered Climate Adaptation Dashboard</h3>
            <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Climate adaptation plans are buried in hundreds of pages of PDF documents, making it nearly impossible to quickly compare strategies across cities or extract structured insights.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Built a full-stack web application using GPT-4 API to automatically parse climate adaptation PDFs, extract structured data (risks, infrastructure, financing, stakeholders), and generate LLM-based recommendations. Created interactive maps and comparison tools for multi-city analysis.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Tech Stack:</strong> Flask backend | OpenAI API for NLP | PyMuPDF for document parsing | Leaflet.js for interactive mapping | Bootstrap UI</p>
