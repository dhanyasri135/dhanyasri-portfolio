      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi! I'm Dhanyasri Bolla — an M.S. student in Engineering Management at The George Washington University and a Graduate Research Assistant at FEWS Labs (GWU).
        My work sits at the intersection of climate adaptation, data analytics, and applied policy research.
      </p>
      <p>
        Recently, I’ve built a quantitative framework to analyze climate action plans across <strong>43 global megacities</strong>, mapped adaptation <strong>co-benefits</strong> using the GAMI database (<strong>430+ articles</strong>),
        and combined statistical methods (chi-square, Cramer’s V, regression) with <strong>LLM-based textual analysis</strong> to extract patterns from policy documents.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond research, I’ve worked on web development, marketing analytics, systems architecture, and energy-transition modeling—building tools and insights that are clear, usable, and decision-focused.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I'm not working, you’ll find me exploring urban spaces and planning community events with fellow graduate students.

              <p>Primary author of a research paper analyzing climate vulnerabilities and adaptation strategies in 43 global megacities.</p>

                <b>Abstract:</b> With their rapid expansion and escalating population densities, megacities face unprecedented challenges in ensuring climate resilience. Our research examines how megacities worldwide plan to adapt to climate change. Specifically, we evaluate the resilience and adaptive capacity enumerated in 43 global megacity climate reports by categorizing and coding data across five key dimensions: infrastructure systems, climate risks, natural disasters, financial sources, and stakeholder involvement. We analyze trends and relationships between variables across these megacity reports to deduce global trends in these urban areas using statistical analysis. Three key patterns emerge from our analysis of these megacity adaptation plans: (1) there is global convergence on the need for sustainable transportation infrastructure, (2) there is some misalignment between local climate risks and chosen adaptation investments, and (3) we found considerable underrepresentation of local stakeholders in planning processes. By identifying key areas of vulnerability, infrastructure plans, financial backing, and stakeholders, our research underscores gaps in current planning approaches that could be addressed in the future to make megacities safer and more sustainable.

                <b>Abstract:</b> Adaptations to extreme weather events are increasing in prevalence across the globe. Adaptation responses can produce cobenefits, which are ancillary positive outcomes beyond the primary objectives of reducing risk and enhancing resilience.
Despite growing attention to co-benefits in the adaptation literature, systematic analyses across adaptation types, sectors,
actors, and regions remain limited. This study uses the Global Adaptation Mapping Initiative (GAMI) database to investigate
the associations between adaptation characteristics and the presence of co-benefits. We processed and coded 1,684 articles, to
categorize co-benefits and analyzed them alongside other adaptation characteristics through descriptive statistics, chi-squared
tests, and logistic regressions. We found generally weak associations between adaptation characteristics and the presence of
co-benefits. Further, the regression results showed that there were no significant differences between the associations with cobenefits of adaptations that occur across economic sectors. Ecosystem based responses were found to be more likely to be
associated with the presence of co-benefits than human behavioral based responses. Technical or infrastructural responses
were found to be less likely to be associated with co-benefits than human behavioral responses. Additionally, while some of
the chi-squared associations and regression associations trended together, they also differed leading to ambiguity in the types
of adaptations that often have co-benefits present. These findings highlight the need for improved co-benefit assessment
frameworks and enhanced co-benefit documentation. Enhanced documentation could better inform adaptation planning and
maximize the ancillary benefits of adaptation actions.
